    "We can use the `datetime` library to create a `datetime` object for determining the current date and time. These datetime objects are very useful but they are not always intuitive to use. To have them output a \"date\" in the manner to which we are accustomed, you have to use `.strftime()` (string formatted time) method with \"format codes\" to get a string in the format you may want.\n",

    "How does anyone know or remember those date codes do??? I sure don't remember them. I use https://strftime.org/ to remind me. In this case, the code `\"%Y\"` gets replaced by the year in YYYY format. The `\"%m\"` code gets replaced with the month as a \"zero-padded number\". Same with `\"%d\"` for the day. I used hyphens to separate them so it comes out like this \"2022-04-04\".\n",
