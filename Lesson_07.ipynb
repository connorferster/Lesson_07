    "### One Task Per Function (\"OTPF\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The functional programming style generally sticks to the central precept of **one task per function**. This is not just some arbitrary \"law of programming\". It is profoundly good advice intended to make your life as easy as possible in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. OTPF makes focuses your mind on a single task. It is much easier to design and write a function that does one thing. It prevents you from getting \"lost in the weeds\" as you try to do too much at once.\n",
    "2. Code reuse becomes more likely if your functions focus on a single task. OTPF tends to make your function more \"general\". The more \"specialized\" your function gets by bundling more tasks into the function, the less useful the function becomes to a different purpose. **In some ways, code reuse is the \"holy grail\" for programmers:** imagine sitting down to write a program only to realize you have already written 80% of the components in other programs! You just need to hook them together!\n",
    "3. Debugging and maintainability becomes MUCH easier in a function that only does one thing.\n",
    "4. In the programming world, it is widely recognized that \"code is more often read than it is written\". Code is only written ONCE! But, you (or someone else) may need to go back and review what you have written several times if you are debugging it or adding more features. If your function called `plot_artworks()` plots the artworks AND also returns the results to the screen AND also saves the results in a file, you may have a hard time finding the \"function responsible\" for saving faulty files because all you see in front of you is `plot_artworks()`.\n",
    "5. Testing. Testing. Testing. It is MUCH easier and faster to write tests and anticipate \"edge cases\" in functions that only do one thing."

    "* **CSV/TSV file**: Comma-separated values or Tab-separated values. These are essentially the same format: tabular-type data with each _record_ of data on a new line and the _fields_ for each record are separated by some character (commonly a ',' or a tab '    '). **Python has the `csv` module in the standard library to read CSV files**. Many software programs will export a CSV file.\n",
    "* **JSON file**: JavaScript Object Notation is a common type of file for data transmitted on the internet and is also a convenient file type for storing data that may not fit neatly into a table, such as nested data. JSON looks exactly like a Python dictionary with data in it. **Python has the `json` module in the standard library to read JSON files**. Jupyter Notebook .ipynb files are JSON files.\n",
    "* **XML file**: eXtensible Markup Language is a file format that looks like HTML but instead of the tags representing document formatting, they represent data fields. Like JSON, it is a convenient format for storing data that may not fit neatly into a table. **Python has the `xml` module in the standard library to read XML files**. Decon files are XML files.\n",
    "* **Mixed formats**: Some programs create text-based files in a mix of formats. For example, spColumn .cti files are kind of like chunks of CSV data mixed with custom headings and metadata (data about the data). SConcrete .sco files are most similar to JSON files but with terrible formatting that makes it difficult for a computer to read without a customized program to read it."
