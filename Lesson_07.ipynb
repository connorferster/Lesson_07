    "\n",
    "`handcalcs` is about rendering python arithmetic expressions similar to how you would write them out by hand:\n",
    "1. Display the symbolic formula\n",
    "2. Followed by the numeric substitutions\n",
    "3. Followed by the result\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are other excellent software programs for doing similar stuff (SMath Studio, MathCAD), handcalcs is different in three ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It shows the numeric substitution\n",
    "2. You don't have to click and drag your formulas around on the page: it's just laid out nicely\n",
    "3. It's free and open-source\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run your cell, handcalcs first reads the code in your cell (as thought it were in a text file) and tells Python to run your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "It splits the numbers and operators apart and then uses several `for` loops to _transform_ each of the python code strings into $\\LaTeX$ strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it gets the calculated results from Python and puts the appropriate result at the end of your calculation code.\n",

    "# handcalcs cell commands\n",
    "\n",
    "When using `%%render` there are some additional commands you can put afterwards that alters the behaviour of how handcalcs displays your calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `params` - Does not render the formula or the subsitution. Just displays the variable (symbol) and the value (result) within a three column layout. Useful for displaying input parameters in a condensed fashion or any value for which the calculation is trivial.\n",
    "* `symbolic` - Does not render the numeric substition or the result. Renders the variable (symbol) and the formula.\n",
    "* `short` - Some formulas are really long and do not fit on one line. handcalcs tries to guess if your equation is too long and, if so, it will break it up over three lines. Sometimes it guesses wrong. If you want your formula to displayed on one line _as though it were a \"short\" equation_ then use `short`.\n",
    "* `long` - Similar to above. If your equation is quite long but handcalcs guesses that it is short, then use `long` to display it over three lines _as though it were a \"long\" equation_.\n",
    "* `sympy` - Useful when you are doing algebraic manipulation with sympy expressions. Use `sympy` when you are ready to subsitute numerical values for your sympy symbols.\n",
    "* `<n>` - Can be used on it's own or with `params`, `short`, and `long`. handcalcs defaults to only showing three decimals of precision. You can enter an integer as a cell command to change the number of decimal places displayed by the numbers _in that cell_.\n",
