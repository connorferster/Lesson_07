On Windows that starts with a drive letter, i.e. `C:/` and deepens in relation to the root, e.g. `C:/Users/your_name/Desktop`.

    "* `path.touch()` - Similar to `.mkdir()`, navigate into a directory that exists and then create a path to a file that does not exist yet (after you do, running `.exists()` on your file path should return False). Then run `.touch()` to make that new file exist.\n",
    "* `path.rename(new_path)` - Moves/renames the current path on your machine to the `new_path`. If you are want to just change the file name, you should include the full path (i.e. all of the parents) up to that file, e.g. `my_path.rename(my_path.parents / \"new_file_name.ext\")`\n",
    "* `path.glob(match_str)` - Returns an iterator of the contents of the directory at `path` (if `path` is a directory and not a file) that matches the `match_str`. Use `\"*\"` as a \"wild card\" to match files of a certain types or names. \n",
